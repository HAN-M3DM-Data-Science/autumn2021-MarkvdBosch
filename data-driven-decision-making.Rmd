## Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?

3DM plays a big role for Bol. The ability to respond quickly to changing consumer habits has always been crucial to retail. Online, this is even more true, as shoppers will quickly look elsewhere if they don't have exactly what they want at the time they want something.
3DM provides fast, accurate data insights for key aspects such as buying habits and seasonal trends. This allows Bol to quickly adjust their market and product offerings so that customers can easily find what they need. With 3DM, they also have greater control over their business operations, such as inventory management, assortment quality and stock levels. This has allowed them to improve customer service while reducing their environmental impact.



## How did the organization apply 3DM?

They use data in many different places such as the search engine and recommender system, forecasting of sales and customer service and their chatbot. 
The organisation also uses their data in Tableau to create an internal dashboard that gives them insight on opportunities and trends.
